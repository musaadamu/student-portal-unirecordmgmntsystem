# Routing Fix Plan

## Steps to Complete:

1. [x] Update `main.tsx` - Move all routing logic from App.tsx to main.tsx using createBrowserRouter
2. [x] Fix Route Paths - Add trailing "*" to parent routes that have child routes
3. [x] Simplify `App.tsx` - Remove routing logic and make it a simple component
4. [ ] Test the routing to ensure all paths work correctly
5. [ ] Verify authentication flow works properly
6. [ ] Check for any 404 errors on resources

## Current Status: Ready for testing
